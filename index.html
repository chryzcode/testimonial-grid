          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
          joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have
          heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup. ”

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
          from their experiences was easy.

        <div class="body">
          “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
          confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
          standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

        <div class="body">
          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
